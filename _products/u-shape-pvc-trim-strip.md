Concave Decorative Strip – Premium PVC Grooved Edge Trim  
(Also known as Concave U-Profile / Recessed Channel Edge Banding / Groove Decorative Molding)   
Transform raw, unfinished edges into elegant, modern recessed accents with our high-quality PVC Concave Decorative Strip. Specially designed with a graceful inward-curved (concave) profile, this trim creates a subtle shadowed groove effect that adds depth, sophistication, and a premium designer touch to furniture, cabinets, wall panels, shelves, and more. Perfect for contemporary minimalist interiors, luxury renovations, and creative DIY projects. 

## Key Features:

•	 High-Grade PVC Material  
Made from durable, flexible, and impact-resistant PVC — built to withstand daily use without cracking or peeling.

•	Beautiful Concave Groove Design  
The distinctive inward curve creates a clean recessed shadow line, delivering a high-end, architectural look that flat trims simply cannot achieve.

•	Fully Customizable Aesthetics  
Personalize your space — available in dozens of trendy solid colors, wood grains, metallic finishes, and mirror electroplated options to perfectly match any decor style.

•	Eco-Conscious & Safe  
Environmentally friendlier PVC formulation; low odor, compliant with modern green building standards. Flame-retardant and waterproof for worry-free use.

•	Fade-proof & Dimensionally Stable  
Advanced UV-resistant and anti-deformation technology — colors stay vibrant and shape remains perfect even in humid or sun-exposed areas.

•	Thickened & Highly Workable  
Extra thickness for better coverage and rigidity; easy to cut, miter, curve, and shape with standard tools — ideal for both straight edges and gentle contours.

•	Effortless Peel-and-Stick Installation  
Strong pre-applied 3M-grade self-adhesive backing — simply peel, align, and press for an instant, long-lasting bond (no glue, no mess, no special tools needed).

•	Seamless Color-Matched Accessories  
Optional same-color plastic snap-in / clip-on fasteners available — hidden fixing with zero visible color mismatch for the cleanest professional finish.

•	Wide Range of Specifications  
Multiple groove depths, overall widths (common: 8–25 mm), and lengths to suit different board thicknesses and design requirements — one solution for countless applications.

•	Versatile Application Scenarios

Ideal for: 

•	Kitchen & bathroom cabinet edges 

•	Wardrobe and closet panel finishing 

•	Shelving, TV units, and office desks 

•	Wall panel / wainscoting transitions 

•	Door frames, display cases, and commercial fit-outs 

•	Creative DIY furniture makeovers
