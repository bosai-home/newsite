The Luxury & Lifestyle Approach

The Art of Entry: Premium Zinc Alloy Series Elevate the very first touch of your home. Our Zinc Alloy Lever Door Lock isn't just hardware; it’s a statement of refined taste. Crafted with a "one-piece" die-casting process, the handle offers a substantial, weighted feel that conveys immediate quality. The brushed texture provides a soft, warm contact point, while the minimalist straight-line design adds a touch of modern architectural grace to any room.

## Key Features:

-	Timeless Beauty: Multi-layer electroplating ensures a vibrant, fade-resistant finish that stays pristine.

-	Sensory Design: Rounded edges and a smooth-rebound mechanism provide a whisper-quiet, tactile experience.

-	Legacy Quality: Tested for 200,000 presses, this lock is designed to perform flawlessly for a lifetime.
