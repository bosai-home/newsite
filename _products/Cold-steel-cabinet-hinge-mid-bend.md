Heavy-duty concealed hinge made of thickened cold rolled steel with two-stage hydraulic soft close.
Free-stop opening from 45°–105°; below 45° closes softly and safely—no slamming, no finger pinching.  

## Key Features:  

 Straight Arm | Full Overlay  
Heavy-duty concealed hinge made from thickened cold rolled steel, designed for long-lasting and stable performance. The two-stage hydraulic soft close system allows free-stop opening between 45°–105°, while doors under 45° automatically close softly, preventing slamming and finger pinching.  
Equipped with an extended hydraulic cylinder and rigid pump core, the hinge provides smooth, silent buffering with excellent oil sealing and reduced leakage risk. The six-coil high-toughness spring ensures strong rebound and consistent operation even after long-term use.  
The 35mm hinge cup with 11mm depth increases load-bearing area for firmer door fixing. A U-shaped reinforced anti-drop rivet securely connects the hinge cup and body, improving overall stability. Finished with three-layer electroplating for superior rust resistance.  
Featuring 3D adjustment for easy installation and alignment, this hinge is suitable for 16–25mm door panels and has passed 80,000-cycle durability testing, making it ideal for kitchen cabinets, wardrobes, and furniture projects.
